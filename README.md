# 1. Introduction

**Image AI Enhancer** is a open source application made in Python. The program allows you to select a .png or .jpg image file, convert it, and view both the original image and the enhanced image next to each other. The conversion process uses the DeepAI API where four processes take place: 

1. [Colorization](https://deepai.org/api-docs/#image-colorization "Colorization")
2. [Super Resolution](https://deepai.org/api-docs/#super-resolution "Super Resolution")
3. [Neural Talk](https://deepai.org/api-docs/#neural-talk-2 "Neural Talk 2")
4. [Waifu2x](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/waifu2x "Waifu2x")

The resulting file can then be saved in a directory and file name of the user's choice.
